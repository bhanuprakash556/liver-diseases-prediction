Machine learning is one of the most critical aspects of automated disease diagnosis and disease prediction. It involves data mining algorithms and techniques to analyze medical data. In recent years, liver disorders have excessively increased and liver diseases are becoming one of the most fatal diseases in several countries. In this thesis, liver patient datasets are investigate for building classification models in order to predict liver disease. This thesis implemented a feature model construction and comparative analysis for improving prediction accuracy of Indian liver patients in three phases. In first phase, min max normalization algorithm is applied on the original liver patient datasets collected from UCI repository. In liver dataset prediction second phase, by the use of PSO feature selection, subset (data) of liver patient dataset from whole normalized liver patient datasets is obtained which comprises only significant attributes. Third phase, classification algorithms are applied on the data set. In the fourth phase, the accuracy will be calculated using root mean Square value, root mean error value.J48 algorithm is considered as the better performance algorithm after applying PSO feature selection. Finally, the evaluation is done based on accuracy values.
